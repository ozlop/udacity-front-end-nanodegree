# Feed Reader Testing

## Overview
This project required the building of Jasmine code tests against a pre-made
RSS Feed Reader application. The Udacity starter code for the RSS application
can be found @ [Udac-Feed-Reader-Starter-Code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

The tests included in this repository check against the various features
included in the Udacity Feed Reader application.

## Running Tests
A live version of the tests can be found through [Github Pages](https://ozlop.github.io/udacity-front-end-nanodegree/project4/)

Otherwise, this repository can be cloned/downloaded and the tests can be through
the `index.html` file. Tests will automatically run in a browser where the index
file is opened.
